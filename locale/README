Note that the filename of the .mo file determines the text domain.
Some languages, such as fr_FR require both a fr_FR domain and fr_FR.utf8.
For UNIX systems, the php-gettext package must be installed along with
any language packs for gettext to work.  Thus this may be difficult to
do in an hosted environment.

# Extract translatable strings and create .pot from a source file (login.php):
xgettext -d messages -s -o locale/login.pot login.php 

# Create .po from a .pot for translating into German:
msginit -l de_DE -o login.po -i login.pot

# Compile the file into a gettext binary (.mo):
msgfmt -c -v -o login.mo login.po

# Copy the file into the correct directory structure:
mkdir -p de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/
cp login.mo de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/
cp login.po de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/

# Make sure the system has the language packs necessary. Check output of locale -a
locale -a
sudo apt-get install language-pack-de-base
sudo locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8

# Test gettext output:
export TEXTDOMAINDIR=locale
LANG=de_DE gettext -s -d login "Password"
